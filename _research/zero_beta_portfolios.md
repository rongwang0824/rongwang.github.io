excerpt: 'Zero-beta portfolios, also known as factor-neutral portfolios, are explicitly constructed to have no exposure to systematic risk within a factor model. Despite their foundational role in asset pricing theory, their empirical applications have been relatively limited. This paper investigates the role and implications of zero-beta portfolios in empirical asset pricing research. First, I develop a unified framework for model testing and comparison based on the maximum Sharpe ratio of zero-beta portfolios, applicable to a broad class of factor models. While all models are formally mispecified, machine learning-based models offer clear advantages as the dimensionality of the factor structure grows. Second, I introduce an optimal zero-beta investment strategy that exploits model mispricing, delivering robust out-of-sample performance and outperforming most established strategies even after accounting for transaction costs.'
