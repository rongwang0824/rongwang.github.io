title: "Fiscal Policy and the Government Debt Maturity Structure"
collection: research
category: working_papers
permalink: /research/fiscal_policy_maturity_structure
excerpt: 'This paper studies the attenuating effects of government debt maturity structure on the transmission of fiscal policy shocks. I use local projection methods with external instrumental variables to show that longer maturity or duration significantly dampens the output expansionary and in ationary effects of fiscal policy. A model of fiscal theory of price level is able to nicely rationalize my empirical findings. The main mechanism is that longer duration of the debt portfolio allows the government to exploit more capital gains against the private investors in face of a deficit shock, reducing the desire to inflate away existing debt.'
