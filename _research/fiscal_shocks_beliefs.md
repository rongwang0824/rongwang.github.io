excerpt: 'The zero-beta rate is an important concept in asset pricing due to its implications for the security market line, beta anomaly, risk-free rate, etc. This paper revisits the estimation of the zero-beta rate and argues that existing methods produce high and volatile zero-beta rates arising from two channels: model misspecification and error-invariables. Any model misspecification leads to a non-uniqueness of the zero-beta rate. Measurement errors in betas increase noise in the estimation. Simulation analysis shows that both channels are quantitatively important for increasing the mean and volatility of the estimated zero-beta rate.'
