Welcome! I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Finance at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University. My research focuses on empirical asset pricing and fiscal policy. In particular, I study the testing and comparison of factor models and their implications for investment. I am also interested in fiscal shocks and in how fiscal beliefs shape asset prices.
